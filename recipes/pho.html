            <h2>What Is Pho and What Is It Made Of?
            </h2>
            <p>Pho is a Vietnamese soup consisting of bone broth, rice noodles, and thinly sliced meat (usually beef). It may also be served with bean sprouts, fresh herbs, limes, chiles, and other garnishes.
            </p>
            <p>The origins of pho are a bit murky, but it is generally believed to have originated in early 20th century northern Vietnam. It eventually migrated south after the division of the country in 1954, and gained even more popularity following the Vietnam War as refugees introduced it to other cultures.

            <h2>How to Make Authentic Pho
            </h2>
            <p>This authentic pho recipe was adapted from Chef Eric of Ba Bar's pho recipe. Be sure to plan ahead — authentic pho requires six to 10 hours of cooking time for a flavorful bone broth. For best results, use shank and knee beef bones.

            <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
                </li>
                <li>Place beef bones on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven until browned, about one hour.
                </li>
                <li>Place onion on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven until blackened and soft, about 45 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Place bones, onion, ginger, salt, star anise, and fish sauce in a large stockpot and cover with four quarts of water. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to low. Simmer on low for six to 10 hours. Strain the broth into a saucepan and set aside.
                </li>
                <li>Place rice noodles in a large bowl filled with room temperature water and allow to soak for one hour. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and after the noodles have soaked, place them in the boiling water for one minute. Bring stock to a simmer.
                </li>
                <li>Divide noodles among four serving bowls; top with sirloin, cilantro, and green onion. Pour hot broth over the top. Stir and let sit until the beef is partially cooked and no longer pink, one to two minutes. Serve with bean sprouts, Thai basil, lime wedges, hoisin sauce, and chile-garlic sauce on the side.
