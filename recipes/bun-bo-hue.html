            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Pho is the golden child of noodle soups in Vietnam. Everyone knows it and loves it―it is usually the gateway dish for foreigners to Vietnamese food. Bun bo hue, on the other hand, is that cool, dark, and mysterious cousin that everyone would actually rather hang with. Spicy, funky, and super flavorful, this beef noodle soup requires a few steps and different types of proteins, but the depth and flavor will have you overlooking pho every time you see this dish on a menu.</p>

            <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>For the broth: In a stockpot, add beef shanks, beef bones, and ham hocks, and add enough water to cover by 1 inch. Let soak at room temperature for 30 minutes to draw out any blood. Drain, rinse, then return meat and bones to the same pot. Add fresh water to cover by 1 inch, then bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Cook for 10 minutes (there should be foam and cloudy proteins that float to the top.) Drain and rinse meat and bones well, transfer to a large bowl, and set aside.
                </li>
                <li>In the same large pot, heat oil and annatto seeds over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until oil becomes bright red, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove and discard seeds. Add onion, lemongrass, and chile flakes to the annatto oil and cook, stirring often until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
                </li>
                <li>Add lime leaves, salt, sugar, fish sauce, MSG (if using), and pineapple (if using), along with prepared meat and bones and 5 quarts (4.7L) water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to maintain a simmer, and cook until ham hocks are fork-tender but not falling off the bone, about 1 hour. Transfer ham hocks to a large bowl, let cool slightly, then cover and refrigerate.
                </li>
                <li>Continue to cook broth until beef shank is fork-tender, 2 to 4 hours longer. Remove beef shank, transfer to cutting board, let stand until cool enough to handle, then slice beef shank 1/4 inch thick and set aside. Strain broth, discard solids, then return broth to pot.
                </li>
                <li>Meanwhile, in a small pot, combine shrimp paste with 2 cups (475ml) water, and bring to a boil over high heat. Remove from heat, stir, and let sit for 30 minutes. Using a laddle or large spoon, transfer shrimp-paste liquid to the broth, being careful to leave any shrimp paste sediment behind. Season to taste with sugar and/or fish sauce. Hold broth warm over low heat until ready to serve.
                </li>
                <li>For serving: Rewarm ham hocks in the broth. In each soup bowl, add 7 ounces (200g) noodles, top with 5 or 6 slices reserved beef shank, 1 ham hock, 1 slice pork blood cake, and 2 or 3 pieces steamed ham, followed by a handful each of green onions, yellow onion, and cilantro.
                </li>
                <li>Return broth to a boil, then ladle enough hot broth into each bowl to cover noodles.
                </li>
                <li>Serve immediately with a plate of fresh mint, banana blossom or cabbage, bean sprouts, chiles, and lime wedges alongside, as well as extra shrimp paste if desired.
