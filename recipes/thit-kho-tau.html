    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pork Belly: pork belly is the main protein of this Vietnamese caramelized pork recipe. You can also mix in pork leg as well.
        </li>
        <li>Salt and pepper: marinate and season the pork belly.
        </li>
        <li>Sugar: the sugar balances out the savoriness of the dish and adds a touch of sweetness for that perfect savory and sweet balance.
        </li>
        <li>Garlic and Shallot: garlic and shallots are the main aromatics for this thit kho recipe.
        </li>
        <li>Eggs: you can add more or reduce the number of eggs based on your preference.
        </li>
        <li>Coco Rico Soda: coco rico soda is a popular ingredient in Vietnamese cooking. It will be the main ingredient in breaking down the pork belly and creating the sweet and savory addicting sauce.
        </li>
        <li>Fish sauce: this would not be a traditional Vietnamese dish without fish sauce! Fish sauce adds a delicious salty and umami finish to this thit kho tau recipe. My favorite brands are Red Boat Fish sauce and Three Crabs fish sauce
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2> 
    <ol>
        <li>Parboil the pork belly. In a large pot, add the pork belly and cover with water and 1 tablespoon of salt. Bring the water to a boil and then boil the pork belly for 3 minutes then remove the pork belly and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Marinate the pork belly. In a large bowl, combine the sugar, salt, pepper, sliced garlic, minced shallot, and pork belly. Mix thoroughly to coat the pork and marinate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
        </li>
        <li>Cook the eggs. While the pork belly is marinating, heat a large pot of water to a boil. Gently place the eggs into the water with a slotted spoon and boil for 10 minutes. Then remove the eggs and soak them in ice water for 10 minutes. Peel the eggs and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Cook the pork belly. Transfer the pork belly with the garlic and shallots into a large pot. Then add the coco rico soda until it covers the pork about 1 inch on top. Bring the pot to a boil on high heat. Once it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to medium heat and cover the pot and simmer the pork for 1 1/2 hours.
        </li>
        <li>Add the eggs and fish sauce. After 1 1/2 hours, skim the scum off the surface of the pot. Then add the eggs and fish sauce and cover the pot and continue simmering for another 1 1/2 hours until the sauce turns brown and the pork is tender.
        </li>
        <li>Serve. Serve immediately with rice and pickled greens!
